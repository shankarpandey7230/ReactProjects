## Steps

#### Explore Data

Navigate to data.jsx and explore arrays

#### Creating Components

Three components : Home, Modal, and Sidebar. Render them in App.jsx.

### Global Context

Setup global context and don't forget to implement a custom hook.

#### Global State values

Set up two state values, both booleans, isSidebarOpen and isModalOpen. Also set up four functions to open and close the modal and sidebar, making all these values available in the application.

#### Home Component

In Home, set up two buttons and get two functions from global context, openSidebar and openModal. Once teh user clicks the button, invoke one of the functions. Set up CSS for the buttons.

#### Modal and Sidebar Component

Create a Modal Component and add modal CSS. Repeat the same steps with Sidebar Component.
